# Introduction
Stroke is a severe cerebrovascular disease caused by an interruption of blood flow from and to
the brain. As a direct consequence of this interruption, the brain is not able to receive oxygen
and nutrients for its correct functioning. The other way around, the brain is not able to drain and
expel through blood vessels all of its waste, like dead cells. In a question of minutes, the brain is
in a critical condition as brain cells will imminently begin to die.
The American Stroke Association indicates that stroke is the fifth cause of death and disability in
the United States. For this reason, stroke is considered a severe disease and has been the
subject of extensive research, not only in the medical field but also in data science and machine
learning studies
